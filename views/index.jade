      p Hello, my name is Nathaniel Houlihan.  I am a software engineer, currently working as a CWEP contractor at Lockheed Martin.  I am a senior at the University of Central Florida, working toward my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I spend most of my time programming and working on personal projects.  I love technology, have a passion for innovation, and hope someday to change the future.

    p Through the majority of my college career, I have worked as a contractor at Lockheed Martin.  During my employment, I have worked on two different projects, holding different roles.  These roles include programming for simulations, testing, support tool design, and constructing technical documentation.  This job has taught me a lot about the software design process, working in a professional setting, and the inner workings of the engineering sector.  I am truly grateful for the opportunity that I have been given.

    p In my free time, I enjoy many activities.  I love playing my guitar, making music, going to the gym and exercising, and attending UCF football games with my friends as often as I can.  I also very much enjoy working on personal coding projects in my free time.  Below is a selection of my personal projects, and all of my personal projects are hosted on my #[a(href='https://github.com/n8houl') Github page].  I began working on each of these projects in order to learn a specific technology or skill with which I was unfamiliar.  They have taught me a lot, and I thoroughly enjoyed each one.
